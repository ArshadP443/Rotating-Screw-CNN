# Rotating-Screw-CNN

Hello everyone! This repository contains the code for the final project I worked on during MITES Semester. It is a convolutional neural network that is able to distinguish whether or not a dot is in a certain range. During my final prokect, I worked with a group consisting of me, Miles Webb, Minghui Zhang, and Henry Dang. We obtained 50 vidoes of a screw on a spinning wheel, converted them into 12 fps videos, and labeled them 0 or 1 depending on if they were "in range". Finally, we created a CNN using pytorch.
